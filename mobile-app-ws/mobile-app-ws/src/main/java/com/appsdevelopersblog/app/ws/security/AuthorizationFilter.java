//This filter class is for validating provided JWT access token. This is needed when a client application sends a request to a protected API endpoint.
//For example, when client application sends a request to update user details, The API endpoint that is for updating user details should be-
//-protected and only authorized users can invoke this endpoint. A request to a protected API endpoint must be protected with JWT access token.
//If JWT token is correct, its owner is authorized to perform the update operation. Request will be accepted.

//BasicAuthenticationFilter class is from Spring Security and it processes HTTP requests with basic authorization headers,
// And puts the result into Spring Security Context.
/*So basically we are going to read JWT access token from authorization header, validate JWT and if it is correct, we will put user authentication-
* -information into Spring Security Context Holder.*/
